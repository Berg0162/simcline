The SIMCLINE physically adjusts the bike position to mimic hilly roads, climbing and descending. This allows the rider to naturally change position on the bike, engage climbing muscles, and improve pedaling technique to become a more efficient and powerful climber.<br>
Without user intervention the SIMCLINE will replicate inclines and declines depicted in (online & offline) training programs (like Zwift, Rouvy, VeloReality and many others) that adjust accordingly the resistance of the indoor trainer.<br>
The SIMCLINE auto connects at power up with a smart Wahoo KICKR trainer and let's relive the ascents and descents from favorite rides or routes while training indoors.<br>
The physical reach is: 20% maximum incline and -10% maximum decline. However, the reach that the rider is comfortable with can be adjusted!<br>
The SIMCLINE pairs directly to the Wahoo KICKR smart trainer and with your PC/Laptop with (Zwift) training App for a connection that notifies the SIMCLINE to simulate autonomous the (change in) physical grade of the road during an indoor ride.<br>
During operation an OLED display shows the road grade in digits and in graphics.<br>
The SIMCLINE Companion App (for Android smartphones) can be paired, only when the training App is disconnected, for adjusting operational settings, like Ascent Grade Limit (between 0-20%), Descent Grade Limit (between 0-10%), Road Grade Change Factor (between 0-100%) and manual Up and Down control. Notice that the Companion App has a slightly different functionality depending of what brand of trainer (TACX or Wahoo) is connected, due to specific connectivity differences. <br clear="left">
